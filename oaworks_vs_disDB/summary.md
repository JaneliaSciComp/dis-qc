* The OA.Works dataset had 2,406 papers for Janelia. DIS DB had 2,278 papers. 2,014 papers are in both.
* Presumably, 100% of the papers found by OA.Works are missing author affiliations in the Crossref metadata. I spot-checked three papers, and this was the case for all three.
* 75% (197/264) of the papers that are only in DIS DB lack author affiliations. 47% of those have an author in our Janelia ORCID collection. That leaves a mysterious 105 papers in DIS DB (only) that have neither a Janelia ORCID nor a Janelia affiliation. Spot checking about dozen of them, I suspect that these were manually added by the previous librarian. 10/12 were legit, and two had 'recent' Janelia alumni. 
  * (I say ‘about a dozen’ because 4/16 were inconclusive: there was one broken DOI, and three cases where I couldn’t find the author affiliations on the publisher’s website.)
* There are 38 papers that have Janelia in the author affiliations and that OA.Works missed. About about half are from 2024, so perhaps they just haven't been found yet.
* OA.Works has 63 papers for 2024. DIS DB has 111 papers for 2024.
* I’ve only been manually adding papers to our database since mid-May or so, but of the 9 papers I’ve caught manually, none were in OA.Works. (Two thirds (18/27) of the items that I've added manually have been preprints.)
* OA.Works has 435 papers that have a preprint. DIS DB has 459 papers that have a preprint.
