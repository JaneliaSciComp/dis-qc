Here are some quick and dirty scripts to evaluate Janelia's new publication database, which was built by Rob Svirskas for the Data and Information Services department (DIS). Software for that pipeline is in the repository JaneliaSciComp/dis-utilities. 

In this repository, I'm comparing our database to two other data sources: 
1) Jaime Palay's data recorded in EndNote (which was imported into our database). It looks like those data were mainly gathered starting in 2019, and were gathered entirely manually. 
2) A spreadsheet downloaded from the dashboard that OA.Works made for HHMI. 

I also compared our database to Janelia's figshare data. I downloaded references for all our figshare data sets using the figshare batch management tool.
