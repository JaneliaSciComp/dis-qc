Here are some quick and dirty scripts to evaluate Janelia's new publication database, built by Rob Svirskas for the Data and Information Services department (DIS). That software is in the repository JaneliaSciComp/dis-utilities. In this repository, I'm comparing our data to two other data sources: Jaime Palay's data recorded in EndNote (which was imported into our database). It looks like those data were mainly gathered starting in 2019, and were gathered entirely manually. The other data set I'm comparing our stuff to is from OA.Works, namely a spreadsheet downloaded from the dashboard they made for HHMI. I also compared our database to Janelia's figshare group, whose data I downloaded using the figshare batch management tool.
